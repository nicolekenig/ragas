    "message": "The surname \"Kenigsberg\" has its origins in the German language and is associated with a geographic location. It is derived from the name of the city of K\u00f6nigsberg, which was located in Prussia, specifically in the region that is now Kaliningrad, Russia. The name K\u00f6nigsberg itself means \"King's Mountain\" in German, reflecting the historical rule of the Prussian kings over the area. The city was founded in the 13th century and became a significant cultural and administrative center. So, the surname Kenigsberg likely originated as a toponymic name, indicating that the initial bearer of the name was associated with the city of K\u00f6nigsberg, either through residence, ownership of land, or some other connection."
